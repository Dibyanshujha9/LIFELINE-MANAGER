            As an administrator, you have full control over the Blood Bank
            Management System. Your responsibilities include monitoring donor and
            recipient records, overseeing blood inventory levels, managing hospital
            requests, and ensuring smooth coordination between donation centers and
            healthcare facilities.

          <p className="text-justify">
            Use the navigation panel to access and manage different sections such
            as Donor Lists, Blood Requests, Inventory Logs, and Hospital
            Registrations. Real-time data insights and analytics will help you make
            informed decisions to ensure that every drop counts and reaches those in
            need efficiently.

            Our system is designed to maintain transparency, traceability, and
            accountability at every level. From scheduling donation drives to
            verifying blood compatibility and issuing transfusion reports â€” every
            action taken here plays a crucial role in saving lives.
